# Working with Swap Chains

You might have noticed that in a previous section, we made used this value: `VK_KHR_SWAPCHAIN_EXTENSION_NAME`. So, what *is* a swap chain? It is essentially an **array of images** ready to be presented. One use is frame rate control. Using two buffers is called **double buffering**. The GPU renders completely to a single frame and then displays it. Once it has finished drawing the first frame, it begins drawing the second frame. This occurs even if we're rendering above the rate we're supposed to. Let's assume we're rendering faster than the physical display can display our images. We would then wait and **flip** the second buffer onto the screen. By flipping the image onto the screen during the **vertical blanking interval**, we can write our data while the display is blank. When it refreshes, our image appears on the screen. Other techniques such as **triple buffering** exist.
