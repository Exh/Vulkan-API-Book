# Working with Swap Chains

You might have noticed that in the section before, we made use of this value: `VK_KHR_SWAPCHAIN_EXTENSION_NAME`. So, what *is* a swap chain? It is essentially an **array of images** ready to be presented. It's primary use has to do with frame rate control. An example of using two buffers is called **double buffering**. The GPU renders completely to a single frame and then displays it. Once it has finished drawing the first frame, it begins drawing the second frame. This occurs even if we're rendering above the rate we're supposed to. Assuming we're rendering faster than the monitor can display our images, we would then wait and **flip** the second buffer onto the screen. By flipping the image onto the screen buffer during the **vertical blanking interval**, we can write our data while the monitor is blank and when it refreshes, our image appears on the screen. Other techniques such as **triple buffering** exist.
