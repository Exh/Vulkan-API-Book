# Who am I?

I'm Harry and I'm a young developer who enjoys 3D graphics. I've worked with WebGL, OpenGL, and DirectX and when I heard about Vulkan, I was excited to get started! This is, in a way, and experiment because I'm publishing as I go. Thus, the book may be rough around the edges. Feel free to submit issues or pull requests on Github and add inline comments through Gitbook.
